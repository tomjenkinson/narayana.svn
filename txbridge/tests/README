---------  JBossTS TxBridge Tests
Author: Jonathan Halliday <jonathan.halliday@redhat.com>
Author: Ivo Studensky <istudens@redhat.com>

These tests have been derived from txbridge tests of JBOSSTS_4_16 which were ant based. 

The new tests are powered by Maven + Arquillian. The tests have been changed to work 
on AS7 and JUnit test classes have been renamed to have distinct names in order to 
allow being run by Surefire separately. Also the directory structure has been slightly
changed to comply with Maven standards.


--- Requirements:
1. apache maven tool
2. installed AS7

--- Steps to run:

1. export JBOSS_HOME=<path to AS7>
2. ant test
